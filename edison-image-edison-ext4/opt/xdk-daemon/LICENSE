II. TERMS AND CONDITIONS

1.  LICENSE.

A.  Subject to the restrictions below and the terms in the TOU, Intel grants to you a non-exclusive, non-assignable,
royalty-free copyright license to use the Intel Materials to design, develop or otherwise create or modify software
applications which you may distribute under your own terms, but you may not re-distribute the Intel Materials except
those portions of the Intel Materials that are specifically identified as "demo apps" and "sample code".

B.  Intel grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable patent license under Intel's Licensed Patent
Claims to:

(i) internally make copies of the Intel Materials; and 

(ii) internally use the Intel Materials; and 

(iii) offer to distribute, and distribute, but not sell, the Intel Materials under the license under Intel's
copyrights granted in the preceding paragraph, but only under terms of such license under Intel's copyrights and
not as a sale.

For the purposes of this section, "Licensed Patent Claims" means the claims of Intel's patents that are necessarily
and directly infringed by the reproduction and distribution that is authorized in Section II.1.A of the Intel
Materials, when that Intel Materials is in its unmodified form as delivered by Intel to you and not modified, or
combined with anything else.  Licensed Patent Claims are only those claims which Intel can license without paying,
or getting the consent of, a third party.

C.  The Intel Materials may contain open source software, some of which may be identified in, and licensed in
accordance with, the "license.txt" file or other text or file in the accompanying third party or open source software.

2.  RESTRICTIONS.  Your use of the Intel Materials is expressly limited to and conditioned upon compliance with the
following:

A.  You will not alter, remove or obscure any proprietary notices from the Intel Materials relating to Intel's or
Intel's supplier's intellectual property rights.

B.  You will make reasonable efforts to discontinue use of the portions of the Intel Materials that you are licensed
hereunder to use, upon Intel's release of an update, upgrade or new version of the Intel Materials, and to make
reasonable efforts to distribute updates, upgrades or new versions of your software applications developed with the
updated Intel Materials to your customers who have received any of your software applications developed with the Intel
Materials.

C.  You may not reverse-assemble, reverse-compile, or otherwise reverse-engineer any portion of the Intel Materials
provided solely in binary form.

D.  Intel will not be responsible in any way for any applications that you develop using the Intel Materials.  You
(i) are solely responsible to your customers for any update or support obligation or other liability that may arise
from the distribution of your application and for your applications' compliance with all applicable laws, including,
without limitation, privacy laws, (ii) must not make any statement that your product is "certified," or that its
performance is guaranteed, by Intel, (iii) must not use Intel's name, logo or trademarks to market your product
without written permission of Intel, (iv) shall prohibit disassembly and reverse engineering of the Intel Materials,
and (v) shall indemnify and hold harmless Intel and its suppliers from and against any claims, lawsuits, or damages,
including attorneys' fees, that arise or result from your distribution of any application incorporating or developed
using the Intel Materials.

E.  You will not disable or by-pass any security features of the Intel Materials, or use the Intel Materials to
develop applications that: (i) can disable or by-pass such security features or (ii) can cause a Security
Vulnerability.  "Security Vulnerability" means a weakness or flaw in a product or system's design, operation or
implementation that could be exploited by an attacker to violate the product or system's security or privacy policies,
including, without limitation, a flaw that makes it infeasible, even when the product is properly used, to prevent an
attacker from usurping privileges on a user's system, compromising its data, security or other operational features.
If you become aware that your applications can cause a Security Vulnerability, you agree to (1) immediately notify
Intel, (2) take immediate measures to stop the distribution of your applications, (3) promptly correct such Security
Vulnerability and (4) indemnify and hold harmless Intel for any claims that may be alleged against Intel due to such
Security Vulnerability.

F.  If Intel reasonably believes that the software, data or application that (i) you create using the Intel Materials
or (ii) is stored on servers owned or operated by Intel using the Intel Materials ("Content") and upload on this Site
violates the law, infringes or misappropriates the rights of any third party or otherwise violates a term of the TOU
("Prohibited Content"), Intel may notify you of the Prohibited Content and may request that such Prohibited Content be
removed from servers owned or managed by Intel or that access to the Prohibited Content be disabled.  If you do not
remove or disable access to the Prohibited Content within two business days of Intel's notice, Intel may remove or
disable access to the Prohibited Content.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Intel may remove or disable access to any
Prohibited Content without prior notice in connection with illegal content or as required to comply with law or any
judicial, regulatory or other governmental order or request or to remedy a Security Vulnerability.  If Intel removes
content without prior notice, Intel will provide prompt notice to you unless prohibited by law.  Intel will not
disclose Content, except (1) if you expressly authorize Intel to do so, or (2) to comply with the TOU, or (3) at the
request of a governmental or regulatory body, subpoena or court order.

G.  Intel obtains no right, title or interest from you (or yours licensors) under the TOU in or to (i) any software
applications that you develop using the Intel Materials, including any intellectual property rights that subsist in
those applications, or (ii) to the Content.  By posting or storing the Content on or through the Intel Materials or
this Site, you give Intel a worldwide, royalty-free, and non-exclusive license to reproduce, adapt, modify, translate,
publish, publicly perform, publicly display and distribute such Content for the sole purpose of enabling Intel to
provide you with the Intel Materials.

H.  If you use the Intel Materials to develop applications for others or store data supplied by others, you will
protect the privacy and legal rights of those users.  If the users provide you with user names, passwords, or other
login information or personal information, you will make the users aware that the information will be available to
your application, and you will provide legally adequate privacy notice and protection for those users.  If your
application stores personal or sensitive information provided by users, it must do so securely.  If the user provides
your application with Intel account information, your application may only use that information to access the user's
Intel account when, and for the limited purposes for which, the user has given you permission to do so.

I.  You will not (i) engage in any activity with the Intel Materials, including the distribution or storage of an
application, that interferes with, disrupts, damages, or accesses in an unauthorized manner the servers, networks, or
other properties or services of any third party, including, without limitation, Intel or any mobile communications
carrier, or (ii) use the Intel Materials to upload, post, host, or transmit unsolicited email, SMS, or "spam" messages.

J.  You will not access (or attempt to access) the administrative interface of the Intel Materials by any means other
than through the interface that is provided by Intel in connection with the Intel Materials or engage in any activity
that interferes with or disrupts the Intel Materials (or the servers and networks which are connected to the Intel
Materials).

K.  If you use the Intel Materials to store or run applications developed by a third party or that access data,
content or resources provided by a third party, you agree that Intel is not responsible for those applications, data,
content, or resources.  All data, content or resources that you may access through such third party applications are
the sole responsibility of the person from which they originated.  Intel is not liable for any loss or damage that you
may experience as a result of the use or access of any of those third party applications, data, content, or resources.
The data, content, and resources presented to you through such a third party application may be protected by
intellectual property rights that are owned by the providers (or by other persons or companies on their behalf).  You
may not modify, rent, lease, loan, sell, distribute or create derivative works based on these data, content, or
resources (either in whole or in part) unless you have been specifically given permission to do so by the relevant
owners.  You acknowledge that your use of such third party applications, data, content, or resources may be subject to
separate terms between you and the relevant third party.  In that case, the TOU does not affect your legal
relationship with these third parties.

3.  OWNERSHIP OF INTEL MATERIALS.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, title to all copies of the Intel
Materials remains with Intel or its suppliers. The Intel Materials are copyrighted and protected by the laws of the
United States and other countries, and international treaty provisions and are licensed under the TOU and not sold.
You may not remove any copyright notices from the Intel Materials.  Intel may make changes to the Intel Materials,
or to items referenced therein, at any time without notice, but is not obligated to support or update the Intel
Materials.  Except for the express copyright license granted under the TOU, Intel grants no express or implied right
or license under any Intel patents, copyrights, trademarks, or other intellectual property rights.

4.  USER SUBMISSIONS AND FEEDBACK;

A.  This Agreement does not obligate you to provide Intel with materials, information, comments, suggestions or other
communication regarding the Intel Materials or the Site.  However, you agree that any material, information, comments,
suggestions or other communication you transmit or post to an Intel website (including, but not limited to,
submissions to the Intel Premier Support and/or other customer support websites or online portals) or provide to Intel
under the TOU related to the features, functions, performance or use of the Intel Materials and the Site are deemed
non-confidential and non-proprietary ("Communications").  Intel will have no obligations with respect to the
Communications.  You hereby grant to Intel and its subsidiaries a non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free,
license to copy, modify, create derivative works, publicly display, disclose, distribute, license, sublicense through
multiple tiers of distribution and licensees, and incorporate and otherwise use the Communications and all data,
images, sounds, text, and other things embodied therein, including derivative works thereto, for any and all
commercial or non-commercial purposes.  You are prohibited from posting or transmitting to or from an Intel website or
provide to Intel any unlawful, threatening, libelous, defamatory, obscene, pornographic, or other material that would
violate any law.  If you wish to provide Intel with information that you intend to be treated as confidential
information, Intel requires that such confidential information be provided pursuant to a non-disclosure agreement
("NDA") signed by Intel, so please contact your Intel representative to ensure the proper NDA is in place.

B.  Nothing in the TOU will be construed as preventing Intel from reviewing your Communications and errors or defects
in Intel products discovered while reviewing your Communications. Furthermore, nothing in the TOU will be construed as
preventing Intel from implementing independently-developed enhancements to Intel's own error diagnosis methodology to
detect errors or defects in Intel products discovered while reviewing your Communications or to implement bug fixes or
enhancements in Intel products. The foregoing may include the right to include your Communications in regression test
suites.

5.  EXCLUSION OF OTHER WARRANTIES.  THE INTEL MATERIALS AND THE SITE ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR

TOU, Intel may at any time terminate or suspend you as a registered user to this Site.  Notwithstanding any other
provision of the TOU, Intel may suspend your status as a registered user to this Site if Intel believes it to be
reasonable.  Before suspending your account, Intel will notify you by e-mail to your registered e-mail address.  You
