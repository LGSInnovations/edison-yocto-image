Package: dbus-dev
Version: 1.6.18-r0
Description: D-Bus message bus - Development files
 D-Bus is a message bus system, a simple way for applications to talk to
 one another. In addition to interprocess communication, D-Bus helps
 coordinate process lifecycle; it makes it simple and reliable to code a
 \"single instance\" application or daemon, and to launch applications and
 daemons on demand when their services are needed.  This package contains
 symbolic links, header files, and related items necessary for software
 development.
