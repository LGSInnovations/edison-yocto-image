Package: libffi6
Version: 3.0.13-r0
Description: A portable foreign function interface library
 The `libffi' library provides a portable, high level programming
 interface to various calling conventions.  This allows a programmer to
 call any function specified by a call interface description at run time.
 FFI stands for Foreign Function Interface.  A foreign function interface
 is the popular name for the interface that allows code written in one
 language to call code written in another language.  The `libffi' library
 really only provides the lowest, machine dependent layer of a fully
 featured foreign function interface.  A layer must exist above `libffi'
 that handles type conversions for values passed between the two
 languages.
